Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Assignments 📚
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my practical implementations for fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each program is designed to demonstrate core computer science concepts, algorithmic logic, and efficient problem-solving.

This project was completed as part of my coursework for the [DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS PRACTICALS] program.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: [C ]

Compiler/Environment: VS Code
📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by assignment modules. Each directory contains the source code for all problems related to that topic.

/Assignment-1 (Array and Matrix Fundamentals):
1.Finding the Minimum Value: Locates the smallest element in an array.

2.Finding the Second Minimum Value: Finds the second unique smallest element.

3.Array Rotation: Implements left/right rotation of array elements.

4.Matrix Operations: Basic operations on 2D arrays (matrices).

5.Finding the Second Largest Value: Locates the second largest element in an array.

Assignment-2 (Sorting and Searching Algorithms):
1.Selection Sort: Implementation of the in-place comparison sorting algorithm.

2.Quick Sort: Implementation of the efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.

3.Binary Search: Implementation of the search algorithm for sorted arrays.

4.Linear Search: Implementation of the sequential search algorithm.

5.Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
🧠 Core Concepts Demonstrated
This project showcases a practical understanding of:

Array & Matrix Operations: Efficient data manipulation, traversal, and mutation of 1D and 2D arrays.

Algorithmic Logic: Implementation of iteration, recursion (for Quick Sort), and complex conditional logic.

Sorting & Searching: Understanding the implementation and trade-offs of fundamental algorithms.

Problem-Solving: Deconstructing complex problems into manageable, code-based solutions.
